# Proposal For the Class Remainder

## Objective of the Class Reminder App
- Our app is used to display the class schedule along with the time and location. Once the user logs in, He/She will be able to see the list of his/her upcoming classes based on their class schedule. It always shows the reminder of first class in the home page that user has to attend.

## Overview
- This app contains 2 screens to display the upcoming classes of the student.
- The upcoming class details with timings and location will be displayed in a rectangular box on the first screen.
- The first screen has buttons like login, home and upcoming classes which navigates to other screens.
- The user can view his/her upcoming class list when he/she clicks on upcoming classes button.
